IF at all we get any error on executing maven projects whihc worked on other machine but not working on current machine
Then  compltely delete .m2/* and let maven rebuild repository under .m2/repository
It can happen that due to discrepencey in m2 repository you get stanrgeer errors like NoClassDef found etc
Soliution is to rebuild local maven repository

****************It is very very Important ********************
